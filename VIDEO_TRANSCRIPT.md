## 🎬 VIDEO SCRIPT

### [0:00 - 0:15] HOOK & INTRODUCTION

**[Show the app landing page]**

> "As a supplier, have you ever submitted a quote and wondered... am I too expensive? Too cheap? Will the buyer even consider my offer?"
>
> "Meet the **AI Quote Analyzer** — a real-time tool that tells you exactly how competitive your quote is before you submit it."

---

### [0:15 - 0:35] THE PROBLEM

**[Show traditional quoting process - spreadsheets, guesswork]**

> "Traditional quoting is a guessing game. You don't know current market prices. You don't know what the buyer really prioritizes. And you definitely don't know how you stack up against competitors."
>
> "This leads to lost deals — either you price too high and lose to competition, or you price too low and leave money on the table."

---

### [0:35 - 1:05] THE SOLUTION - HOW IT WORKS

**[Screen recording of the app in action]**

> "The AI Quote Analyzer solves this in three simple steps:"

**[Step 1 - Search Materials]**
> "First, search for the materials or parts you're quoting — like steel, aluminum, or semiconductors. The system instantly fetches **real-time market prices** from across the industry."

**[Step 2 - Enter Your Prices]**
> "Next, enter YOUR quote prices. The app immediately shows you whether you're above or below market — with exact percentages. You can also specify your delivery times, quality scores, and payment terms."

**[Step 3 - Search the Buyer]**
> "Finally, search for your target buyer — like Toyota, Tesla, or Apple. The AI pulls their **procurement profile**, including what they prioritize: Is it price? Quality? Speed? Sustainability?"

**[Click Calculate]**
> "Hit analyze, and within seconds you get your **Attractiveness Score** — a 0 to 100 rating of how likely the buyer is to accept your quote."

> "But it doesn't stop at a number. You get a full breakdown:"

> - "**Delivery Reliability** — Are your lead times competitive?"
> - "**Sustainability Fit** — Important for ESG-focused buyers"

**[Show the recommendations section]**
